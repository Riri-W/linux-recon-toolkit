My Linux enumeration and training scripts as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.
# Linux Recon Toolkit

## Day 1 Progress (Phone Session)
- Started Linux fundamentals journey.
- Learned basic commands: ls, pwd, cd, cat.
- Studied what SSH is and why it is used in security.
- Practising Bandit levels 0-1

## Purpose
This repository will store my Linux-based recon and enumeration scripts as I build my cybersecurity skillset.

Day 1 (Practical):
- Connected to OverTheWire Bandit using SSH.
- Executed basic Linux commands: ls, pwd, whoami, cat.
- Retrieved Level 1 password from remote system.
  
Day 1: First SSH access and Bandit Level 0 complete
🧠 Why This Was a Big Deal (Even If It Felt Simple)

You just demonstrated:

Remote system access

Command-line navigation

Credential discovery

Session control

That is the foundation of both hacking and defense.

Day 2:
- Completed Bandit Level 1 → 2.
- Learned how to handle files with special names using ./ and --.
- Practiced ls -la and safe file reading.

Day 2: Handled special filenames and completed Bandit Level 1

Day 3:
- Completed Bandit Level 2 → 3.
- Learned Linux file permissions (rwx).
- Practiced handling filenames with spaces using quoting and escaping.
- Learned how users and groups control access to files.
Day 3: Permissions & filenames with spaces (Bandit 2→3)
